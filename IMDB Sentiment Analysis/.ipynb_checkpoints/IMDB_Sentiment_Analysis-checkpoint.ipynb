They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.</td>\n",

We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "4  Petter Matteis Love in the Time of Money is a visually stunning film to watch Mr Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect Each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact Stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitatThe only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounterThe acting is good under Mr Matteis direction Steve Buscemi Rosario Dawson Carol Kane Michael Imperioli Adrian Grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come aliveWe wish Mr Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
